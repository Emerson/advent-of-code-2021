Advent of Code 2020

To run this, you need to add a .env file containing the line:
`AOC_SESSION=XXX`
where `XXX` is your session token. You can grab this token from the cookies on https://adventofcode.com after you're logged in.

Run each day by running `npm start {n}` where `{n}` is the current day.

Calls to the server are cached, so you don't have to worry about hitting things too hard :)
